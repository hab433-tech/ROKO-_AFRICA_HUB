## 📘 Summary
This proposal introduces a plan to design and deploy an **Automated Buyback + Burn Executor** — a verifiable, trustless mechanism that performs periodic buybacks of ROKO tokens and burns them transparently.

It aligns with ROKO’s principle of **on-chain transparency, decentralized governance, and open auditability**.

---

## ⚙️ Deliverables
- ✅ Smart contract or script with automated swap (ETH → ROKO → burn)
- ✅ Audited and verified testnet demo transactions
- ✅ Deployment & monitoring documentation
- ✅ Open-source audit + transparency guide

---

## 🕒 Timeline (3 Weeks)
| Week | Focus | Outcome |
|------|--------|----------|
| W1 | Design + Architecture | Contract logic draft + review |
| W2 | Implementation + Testing | Testnet deployment + demo txs |
| W3 | Audit & Public Demo | Audit feedback + proof of execution |

---

## 💰 Request
- Milestone-based development grant (tokens or funding)
- Repo write access for test branch
- Assignment of a mentor/reviewer from ROKO core devs

---

## 📜 Motivation
Creating verifiable buyback and burn systems prevents rug risks and centralization.  
This contract ensures every community token burn is **provable on-chain** through:
- Transparent execution scripts  
- Multisig or timelock execution  
- On-chain proof of swaps and burns  

---

## 🪙 Expected Impact
- Increased investor and community trust  
- Transparent token economics  
- Sustainable liquidity through automated buybacks  
- Strengthened governance via public proofs
