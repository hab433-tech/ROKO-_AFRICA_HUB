# 🧾 ROKO Token — Technical & Audit Roadmap

## Overview
This roadmap outlines the technical milestones and transparency steps required to ensure the ROKO token and ecosystem meet security, compliance, and trust standards. Each milestone will be tracked as **Implemented**, **Partial**, or **Pending** once verified on-chain.

## 🔐 Smart Contract Verification

| Component | Status | Description | Proof/Action |
|------------|---------|--------------|---------------|
| Token Contract | ✅ Implemented | Deployed ERC-20 on Ethereum mainnet. | [View on Etherscan](https://etherscan.io/address/0x66a9893cc07d91d95644aedd05d03f95e1dba8af) |
| Source Code Verified | ⚠️ Partial | Public viewable contract, but needs metadata & compiler verification. | Use Etherscan “Verify & Publish” tool. |
| Ownership Renounced / Multisig | ⏳ Pending | Ownership should be renounced or moved to multisig for decentralization. | Add multisig/timelock contract. |

---

## 💧 Liquidity & Distribution

| Area | Status | Description | Next Step |
|------|---------|--------------|------------|
| LP Creation | ✅ Implemented | Liquidity pool confirmed on Uniswap. | Track LP contract for movement. |
| Token Distribution | ⚠️ Partial | Holders visible, but vesting contracts missing. | Implement vesting/time-lock contracts for transparency. |
| Treasury Wallet | ⏳ Pending | No public address yet. | Publish official treasury wallet for tracking. |

---

## 🧩 Governance & Infrastructure

| Element | Status | Description | Next Step |
|----------|---------|--------------|------------|
| Governance Framework | ⏳ Pending | Community & DAO setup not yet deployed. | Plan proposal/voting contract. |
| Validator / Node Design | ❌ N/A | Token runs on Ethereum, no native validators. | Optional future ROKO-chain research. |
| Audit Report | ⚠️ Partial | Open-source but no third-party audit yet. | Connect with audit firm or GitHub security scan. |

---

## 🧠 Technical Vision (Next Steps)
1. **Complete code verification** on Etherscan.  
2. **Integrate vesting/timelock contracts** for team & community wallets.  
3. **Add a simple staking contract** for user engagement.  
4. **Launch GitHub audit review** — ensure repo matches on-chain bytecode.  
5. **Publish first security review report** with dates and results.
