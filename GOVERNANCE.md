# Governance Framework — ROKO Africa Hub

## Vision
ROKO Africa Hub aims to build a decentralized ecosystem connecting AI, blockchain, and community innovation across Africa. Governance ensures fairness, transparency, and community empowerment.

## Governance Principles
1. **Transparency** — All governance actions and treasury movements are visible on-chain.  
2. **Accountability** — Each decision or fund allocation must be recorded with proof of vote or proposal.  
3. **Inclusion** — Every token holder has the right to propose, vote, and participate.  
4. **Security** — Multi-signature wallets, time-locks, and audits protect the ecosystem.

## Decision-Making Structure
| Tier | Body | Responsibilities |
|------|------|------------------|
| 1 | **Core Team (Temporary)** | Initial deployment, partnerships, early grants |
| 2 | **Community Council** | Elected group of contributors managing proposals & moderation |
| 3 | **Token Holders (DAO)** | Final on-chain voting and parameter approvals |

## Proposal Lifecycle
1. **Draft Stage** — Community member submits an idea in `proposals/` folder or forum.  
2. **Discussion Stage** — The proposal is discussed for 5–7 days.  
3. **Voting Stage** — On-chain or snapshot-based vote (minimum quorum 10% of circulating supply).  
4. **Execution Stage** — If approved, a multisig wallet or timelock contract enforces the decision.

## Treasury Management
- **Multisig Wallet:** Minimum 3-of-5 signers.  
- **Transparency Reports:** Published quarterly.  
- **Spending Rules:** All expenditures must link to a governance proposal.

## Emergency Protocol
If a vulnerability, exploit, or major governance failure occurs:
- Temporary pause via multisig authority (time-limited).  
- Public incident report within 24 hours.  
- Governance resumes only after community approval.

## Long-Term Vision
Once the ecosystem matures, governance transitions fully to token holders under DAO contracts, removing core-team control.
