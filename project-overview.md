- Monitor key liquidity and contract metrics.
- Evaluate the long-term potential of ROKO as both a meme + infrastructure project.

## 🧮 Accumulation Strategy
1. Prioritize **wallet accumulation** over speculation.

## ⚙️ Next Steps
- Gather **GitHub and audit links** for deeper verification.  
- Monitor **LP movements**, **team wallets**, and **community treasury** if available.  
- Keep a personal log of each accumulation round with date, amount, and reasoning.

## 📘 Founder’s Note
> “At this stage, my goal is to accumulate smartly — not rush. If ROKO continues to build both infrastructure and meme strength, the upside will self-fund future expansion without needing grants or external capital.”
